Names of the PNGs in these folders are the type of tail the base uses.

What started as a personal ref sheet for my protogen, ioh, ended up becoming a handful of F2U bases after adding a few variations.

Included are bases with five different tails (inspired by the Nukude VRChat model) and one or two sets of ears. (The bases with 2 sets of ears have a "2" in the title. Enjoy!
