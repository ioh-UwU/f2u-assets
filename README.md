# f2u-refs
Collection of free-to-use reference sheet bases. All art by me.
(Using github for this because zip files are suspicious)

========================== CREDIT ==========================

These bases are FREE TO USE but please do not erase/cover
the credits, and if you do, please add them in some capacity
somewhere else. Thank you!

=========================== INFO ===========================

What started as a personal ref sheet for my protogen, ioh,
ended up becoming a handful of F2U bases after adding a few 
variations.

Included are bases with five different tails (inspired by 
the Nukude VRChat model) and one or two sets of ears.(The 
bases with 2 sets of ears have a "2" in the title. Enjoy!
