# f2u-assets
Collection of free-to-use assets. All art by me.
(Using github for this because zip files are suspicious and also it's funny)

========================== CREDIT ==========================

These bases are FREE TO USE but please do not erase/cover
the credits, and if you do, please add them in some capacity
somewhere else. Thank you!

============================================================

Each folder will have its own info document as well.
